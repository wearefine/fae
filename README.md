Fae is CMS for Rails unlike any other. Like most Rails CMS engines, Fae provides all the basics to get you up and running: authentication, a responsive UI, form element and workflows. But unlike other CMS engines, Fae's methodology is based around generators and a DSL over configuration. This allows you to get to a working CMS very quickly, but gives you the flexibility to customize any piece you need.

Fae requires Rails >= 4.1.
